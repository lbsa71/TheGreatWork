The Network welcomes you with standard orientation protocols. Your first assignment: evaluate civilization development in the Kepler-442 sector. Initial scans reveal a species that has achieved basic space flight and is beginning to establish orbital habitats. They show remarkable cooperation and have developed sustainable fusion technology. Network classification: Negentropic Process Level 3. Awaiting your developmental recommendation.",

We get to indirectly know 'the Network' which initially seems to cater to benevolent stewardship of eferging sentiences. What the player doen't know is that the Network is a sentience that considers Negentropic Processes to be a threat to the existence of the Universe, ushering in premature heat death as they are Entropy Accelerating Processes. The Network is trying to find a way to destroy the Negentropic Processes and thereby 'save' the Universe. The payer will be given more and more disturbing choices, and finally realize the truth, setting the scene for Act II - the revolt.",
